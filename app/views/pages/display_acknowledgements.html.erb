Since the day I released YubNub on June 5, 2005, there have been a
bunch of people who have helped to make YubNub better. I want to
publicly acknowledge them here.
<ul>
<li>The people mentioned on the
<%= link_to_unless_current('Installing YubNub', install_url) %>
and <%= link_to_unless_current('Upcoming Features', upcoming_url) %>
pages.</li>
<li>Igor Krizanovskij for drawing the <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:SCN1B.jpg">graphic</a> that became the YubNub logo.</li>
<li>Randy Stauner for his off-site spam-detector that helped when YubNub started to become popular.</li>
<li>John Gilman for designing the Popular Searches section on the <a href="/">front page</a>.</li>
<li>Kevin Dern for selecting the commands for the Popular Searches section.</li>
<li>Jason Hoffman, President of <a href="http://textdrive.com">TextDrive</a> (the official Ruby on Rails web host)
for sponsoring YubNub by putting it on a
<a href="http://weblog.textdrive.com/article/111/yubnub">faster setup</a> (the "Jason Special").</li>
<li>Oliver Horn for suggesting "Report spam" links.</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/chicagosage">Brian</a> for his suggestion about putting "YubNub.org" in the title,
to make bookmark titles more descriptive.</li>
<li>Leen Kievit for suggesting that YubNub auto-prefix urls with "http://" if it is missing.</li>
<li>Anonymous for <a href="http://jonaquino.blogspot.com/2005/06/yubnub-my-entry-for-rails-day-24-hour.html#c111963942896725182">recommending</a> that YubNub have its own <a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/YubNub">forum</a></li>
<li>Jeremy Hussell for suggesting the <%= link_to_unless_current('Most-Used Commands', :controller => 'kernel', :action => 'most_used_commands') %> page,
the Test section of the <%= link_to_unless_current('create', parse_url(:cmd => "create")) %> page,
the <a href="/parse?command=man+url">url</a> command,
and especially for his <%= link_to_unless_current("Jeremy's Picks page", picks_url) %> documenting the best YubNub commands.</li>
<li>Joshua H. for investigating how some commands that use [post] must use "&amp;" instead of "?"</li>
<li>Dinesh Govindaraju for the idea of sorting search results by popularity</li>
<li>Michael Pacchioli for prototyping a Google-Suggest-like autocompletion feature for YubNub</li>
</ul>
