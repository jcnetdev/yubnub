Great app!

Here is a trvial elisp function so that you can call yubnub from 
Emacs.

To use it, paste the function below into your .emcas file and restart
emacs.  Then you can simply M-x yubnub.  You will be prompted for the
yubnub command.

For example:  M-x yubnub <RET> ls ge <RET>

Your default external browser will then open and return the result.
This has been tested on GNU Emacs both on Redhat and on Windows XP.  
I have only tested this on a fairly recent version of Emacs from CVS,
so it may not work on older Emacsen which does not have "browse-url".

You can change the default browser which browse-url uses by changing 
the variable browse-url-browser-function in customize.

M-x customize-group <RET> browse-url

Send suggestions, problems etc to Brad Collins <brad@chenla.org>

--------

(defun yubnub (command)
  "Use `browse-url' to submits a command to yubnub and opens
result in an external browser defined in `browse-url-browser-function'.

To get started  `M-x yubnub <RET> ls <RET>' will return a list of 
all yubnub commands."
  (interactive "sCommand:")
  (browse-url 
   (concat "http://yubnub.org/parse?command=" command)))

Cheers,

b/

Another rather trivial but useful yubnub hack for Emacs users...

Emacs Planner Mode is a powerful application for project planning,
managing tasks and keeping notes within Emacs.  

Planner-mode is based on Emacs-Wiki-Mode which is a application for
creating and publishing a wiki from Emacs.

One of the most powerful feature of emacs-wiki-mode is you can create new
types of links.

Included is "planner-yubnub.el" which allows you to create extended
wiki hyper-links for yubnub commands:

  ;; To open open a request for comment (rfc)
  ;;  [[yubnub://rfc 2252][See RFC2252]] 
  ;;
  ;; To look up a domain name in the whois database:
  ;;  [[yubnub://whois yubnub.org][whois database entry for yubnub.org]]
  ;;
  ;; To search for something in Google
  ;;  [[yubnub://gg Charles Dickens][Google for Charles Dickens]]

If you are using planner-mode the examples above will look like a href
style hyper-links in a browser.

For more information about planner mode -- use the yubnub command 
  "ewiki PlannerMode"

I will be sending this to the Planner Mode mailing list as well.  If
there is enough interest it will be included in a future release of
planner.

;; 
;; To install, place planner-yubnub.el where emacs can find it
;; and add (require 'planner-bxid) to your .emacs
;;
;; To search for a page in EmacsWiki wiki
;;   [[yubnub://ewiki gnus][search for pages about gnus on EmacsWiki]]

;;; Code:

(require 'planner)

(add-to-list 'emacs-wiki-url-protocols '("yubnub" planner-yubnub-find nil))

(defun planner-yubnub-find (url)
  "If this is a yubnub URL-command, jump to it."
  ;; Remove the yubnub://
  (setq yn-command (replace-regexp-in-string "yubnub://\\(.*\\)" "\\1" url))
  (browse-url (concat "http://yubnub.org/parse?command=" yn-command)))

(provide 'planner-yubnub)

;;; planner-yubnub.el ends here
