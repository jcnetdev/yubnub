# == Converting to ActionMailer::ARMailer
#
# Go to your Rails project:
#
#   $ cd your_rails_project
#
# Create a new migration:
#
#   $ ar_sendmail --create-migration
#
# You'll need to redirect this into a file.  If you want a different name
# provide the --table-name option.
#
# Create a new model:
#
#   $ ar_sendmail --create-model
#
# You'll need to redirect this into a file.  If you want a different name
# provide the --table-name option.
#
# Change your email classes to inherit from ActionMailer::ARMailer instead of
# ActionMailer::Base:
