Styler
======

Styler is designed to DRY up the process of including and generating
stylesheets, so you can think less about stylesheet configuration and more
about styling.


Usage
=====

To use Styler, just update your layout(s) with this code:

<head>
<title>the.rails.ist</title>
<%= stylesheets %>
</head>

Styler will then include your stylesheets automatically:

<head>
<title>the.rails.ist</title>
<link href="/stylesheets/application.css?1170968897" />
<!--[if IE 7]>
<link href="/stylesheets/ie7.css?1170968897" />
<![endif]-->
<!--[if IE 6]>
<link href="/stylesheets/ie6.css?1170968897" />
<![endif]-->
</head>

Styler will also dynamically include stylesheets for each of your
controllers (if such stylesheets are present), so you can keep your styles
organized into logical sections.


Organize your stylesheets
=========================

Styler uses a simple set of conventions:

- Styles for your entire application should be stored in application.css
- Styles for specific controllers should be stored in controller.css
- Styles for specific actions should be stored in controller_action.css
- Styles for Internet Explorer 7 should be stored in ie7.css
- Styles for Internet Explorer 6 should be stored in ie6.css

When used in combination, these conventions can scale up to support pretty
big applications.


Include additional stylesheets
==============================

Conventions are great, but need to add your own stylesheets?

<%= stylesheets :include => "reset" %>
<%= stylesheets :include => ["reset", "fonts"] %>


Use nested stylesheets (optional)
=================================

For bigger projects, you might wish to break your stylesheets into separate 
directories.

To use nested stylesheets, just create subdirectories in public/stylesheets 
for each of your controllers, and then add stylesheets for individual 
actions you wish to style.

- Styles for an entire controller should be stored in controller.css
- Styles for specific actions should be stored in controller/action.css


Generator
=========

Styler also includes a generator that will create a default set of
stylesheets (application.css, ie7.css, and ie6.css) and a separate
stylesheet for each controller in your application.

To use the generator, run this command in your terminal:

script/generate stylesheets

If you add a new controller, just run the generator again and a new
stylesheet for the controller will be created. (Styler will safely ignore
any existing stylesheets.)
