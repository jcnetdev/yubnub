TZInfo Timezone
===============

This plugin installs a replacement for the TimeZone class. The replacement
uses the TZInfo library (http://tzinfo.rubyforge.org) to do the time zone
conversions, and thus takes into account daylight saving, for free.

It is not a 100%-compatible replacement, however. If you use TimeZone#unadjust
anywhere, you'll need to replace those calls, possibly with #local_to_utc.
Also, the #adjust method is deprecated--it is better (and easier to read) if
you use the #utc_to_local method instead.

Note that you will need to have the tzinfo library installed separately--it is
not bundled with this plugin. You can easily install tzinfo as a gem:

  gem install tzinfo
