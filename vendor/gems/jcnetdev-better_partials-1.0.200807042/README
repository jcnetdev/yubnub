better_partials
==============
Provides syntactic suger for render :partial


Example
=======
Render a partial
<%= partial "people/search_box" %>

Pass some parameters in
<% form_for @person do |f| %>
  <%= partial "people/form", :f => f %>
<% end %>

Pass in a collection
<%= partial "people/person", :collection => @people %>

Or the terse way
<%= partials @people %>

Also works, but not as nice reading
<%= partial @people %>

Rendering a block
<% partial "people/box" do %>
  Inner connect goes here.. (gets called in your partial's yield statement)
<% end %>


Special Partial Options pass through to render :partial
(all others are passed through to the :locals parameter)
=======
:collection,
:spacer_template,
:object, 
:use_full_path
